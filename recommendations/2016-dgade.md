Whomsoever it may concern.

I had the opportunity to work with Ethan on multiple projects for about 8 months from April 2015 to December 2015. For all these projects, Ethan was the lead developer cum architect for the project whereas I was the QA team member assigned to test his work. I also worked with him for developing enhancements to the test automation framework used at the Ebay Enterprise.

Ethan is an extremely focused individual. He is immensely knowledgeable about multiple technologies due to which he is able to accurately evaluate and implement different approaches to solve a problem. He has helped make key architectural implementation decisions at crucial points in the software development cycle. He has assisted business managers/users in making important decisions for the project by explaining complicated concepts and technical designs in simple terms. I like his frank and honest â€“ 'A is A' approach for clearly communicating task progress without unnecessarily bloating or deflating facts.

Ethan trusts his team members to get work done. He is able to challenge his team members by assigning important parts of the project and provides support to help complete them. I clearly recall an instance while developing the automation framework enhancements when I got stuck with the implementation details, and Ethan encouraged me to go one step at a time to complete the task. He gave me sound advice and showed me examples of how the task could be accomplished.

Ethan is a thoroughly professional individual. This is clearly demonstrated from the time when we had a production release scheduled around the same time he was expecting a baby. He was able to juggle his personal life as well as professional commitments with ease.

I have no doubt whatsoever that Ethan would be an asset in whichever team he works in.

Please feel free to contact me in case you have more questions.

Yours sincerely,

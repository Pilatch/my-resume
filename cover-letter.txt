Hello.  My name is Ethan B Martin.

In previous work I have delivered on a range of responsibilities: design, testing, research, performance, usability, security, mentoring, building business cases, creating tools, process improvements, code quality and style, architecture of information as well as software, and presentations. Through all of this I communicate with gusto.

My work ethic is to back decisions with investigation, experiments, and consensus.  I have learned when to cross technological boundaries, when to focus on a strong suit, when to exhort, and when to inspire.

Should I join your team, you would value my dedication and energy, as I would honor the motivations that drive your company.

Thank you for your consideration.
